# Graphing Utility
### Computing A Level Project

This is a free general purpose graphing utility designed for use in the classroom to help teach secondary school students how to draw the graphs of various different equations.

The software should work in both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.5.x with PyGame installed on any operating system - may require minor code changes to run properly on Linux (not tested thoroughly).
